Sample project showing vertical UI Issue after changing vc's in tab bar

Issue:

-Upon clicking the button on the first screen the user is presented with view controllers with a top static table, and a table just below.  The view controllers in the tab bar controller that are not within the "more" display correctly.  If I go to "more" and select a view controller the view is displayed with the top cell pushed down.

-If I go to the "more" screen, edit and move the order of view controllers in any way, view controller displayed through "more" display correctly.  Upon leaving the "more" section the top table cell (top table) is not displayed.
